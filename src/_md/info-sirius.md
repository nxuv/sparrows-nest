### *The year is 2397*

Lightyears away from the blossoming Cosmic East, the sea of stars has become a battlefield to a silent civil war, seeded and spurred on by galactic superpowers. The prize? The allegiance of the Sovereignty of Sirius, the richest among the Inner Colonies.

### *A gem of the void, contested by greed and zeal.*

Ruled by a theocratic order of ancient design, the Sovereignty of Sirius stands at an impass, the divide between its ruling caste and worker caste reaching its widest point in centuries. A specter of dissent creeps among the populace, and it bears the flag of the "Naxalites" - a collectivist movement aligned with the Sovereignty's lifelong enemies: the increasingly influential Terran Protectorate.

### *Operation "CORNERSTONE" is a go.*

Weaponizing the mounting dissatisfaction of rebellious elements across all castes, a concerted effort to supply and direct them has manifested itself into increasingly frequent voidborne terror attacks. Attacks in which the lines between friends and foes are shattered to the tune of EM pulses, and in which desperate pleas, panicked lies and misplaced shots score the whittling down of a bicentennial regime.

### *In the shadows of stars, no one can hear you scheme.*

Sirius: Treacherous Reaches is a 5-to-10-player social deduction space combat game inspired by Werewolf,  Secret Hitler,  Battleship  and  Highfleet  -  applying the scheming and dramatics of social deduction games to a grid-based, space combat scenario  in which each player helms their own vessel, and votes are cast by firing its weapons directly onto the grid square of a presumed traitor.

Split into  six Castes,  each with their own particular Ships and Abilities, players will find themselves split between loyal Citizenry  and  rebellious Naxalites: the former trying to smoke out the latter before they can be outnumbered -  in a battle of trust, cunning and wild hunches that will test friendships both in and out of the game!

The game includes  full assets for both tabletop and online play, to include a deck of 16 Ship Cards, four sets of marker tokens (Coordinates, Allegiance, Attack), a two-sheet playfield and an  interactive Command Sheet.

### *Fill up your air tanks and pray you can survive these Treacherous Reaches.*
