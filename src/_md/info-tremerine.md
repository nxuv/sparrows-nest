### *The year is 2394*

Seven years after the tide of violence wrought by the Great Colonial War upset a century-old balance of power, humanity is once again entering an era of fragile peace. From the ashes of the old Avignon Empire, firestarter of the conflict, a federation of former vassal worlds has risen - denying the tantalizing offer of growth and prosperity under the ever-increasing reach of the United Systems Alliance in favor of long-awaited independence.

### *Welcome to the Tremerine Union.*

Built on the principles of "Safety, Equality and Dignity" and spanning nine worlds over four star systems, the Tremerine Union has since established itself as a respectably powerful player on the galactic chessboard - something of a middle ground between the Alliance's gossamer state and the Terran Protectorate's more authoritarian rulings.

Focused on building over the decadence and devastation left in the wake of Avignon's fall, the Union has been working tirelessly to secure the great spaceways and the latest colonies discovered by the empire's Expanse Initiative, which in the meantime had become safe havens for surviving imperial remnants.

This effort would soon lead to the establishment of a national self-defense fleet, doing away with the "opportunity-based" mercenary army model taken from the Alliance in the early, turbulent years of reunification. This fleet now patrols the sea of stars, on the lookout for anyone daring enough to challenge this new peace.

### *Which is where you come in.*

You and your companions find yourselves in the midst of all this, sailing the sea of the stars on the same starship for one reason or another: on a mission, in search of profits, or simply looking for a good time. Each of you may come from a different background or work a different profession, but you will need to cooperate to get the job done.

### *Who will you be in this galaxy of opportunities?*
