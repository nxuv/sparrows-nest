### *The year is MMCDXX*

**Roman Blasters** is a **2-4 player card combat game** largely inspired by strategic depths of **Buckshot Roulette** combined with the casual elements of **UNO, Exploding Kittens**, and **a digital party minigame from the mid-2000s**. Clash head-on with your opponents in a battle to be the last player standing drawing a variety of **weapons, shields** and **support items**.

Face off with a rival in **Classic Duel**, where **the weapons are a surprise to both combatants** and any resources wasted could end the game within seconds.

Alternatively, skirmish with 1-3 more friends in **World Rule**, where **each combatant has their own arsenal** and field events **shake up the course of every battle**!

By default, Roman Blasters includes **full assets for both tabletop and online play, counting 141 playing cards** (split into Attack, Defense, Special, Event, Multi-Shot Cards), **13 "Setup Cards"** (player health bars and initiative number cards) and **a playfield** for use in **virtual tabletop platforms**.
