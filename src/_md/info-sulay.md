### *The year is 2407*

After a century of intermittent conflict, peace seems within reach on the Inner Colonial world of Tau Ceti II. The Greater Sulay Peninsula, mainly known across the galaxy as the backdrop to sun-bleached combat footage and exploitative action films, might have finally reached a critical turning point.

### *A tired peace, born from regret and exhaustion.*

Despite significant ideological and cultural divides, the reality of a frozen frontline, dwindling foreign support and the progressively unjustifiable cost of war have pushed the parties involved to finally, begrudgingly sit at the same table. Representing the north, the Sulay Socialist Assembly: a socialist republic backed by the Terran Protectorate; representing the south, the Southern Sulay Emirates: a league of Sunni citystates backed by the United Systems Alliance.

### *A timely peace, one still worth celebrating.*

From either sides of the Baghlani-Kanzeb Line, a tentative sigh of collective relief ushers the dawn of (hopefully) better days. Once inconceivable shows of cooperation between the two polities begin making the rounds across the galactic infonet - to include a particular racing event, a cross-country charity drive bridging the gap between philantrophy, cultural preservation and offroading thrills.

### *A rally for the ages - hopefully.*

Inspired by **[Ech0](https://roleoverplaydead.itch.io/ech0)**, **[Helan](https://pinayu.itch.io/helan)**, **[Art of Rally](https://www.gog.com/en/game/art_of_rally)** and **[Slipstream](https://www.gog.com/en/game/slipstream)**, **Sulay Rally Raid** is a **journaling RPG for 1 to 2 players**, in which you and (potentially) a friend take the role of **rally drivers** (or rally crew) embarked in an **offroad endurance race** sprawling across **two rival nations** in a process of **tentative detente.**

Starting from the northern capital of **Kaburgrad**, take it to the road in your **Puma SUV** and drive from town to town towards **Nawi Kandahar**, the region's southern capital and final goal of the rally. Roll your **daily route** and see what you run into along the way: from **mountain hairpins** to **rampant wardrones**, everything's written down in a series of **Event Tables** split between **Maneuvers, Hitches** and **Shenanigans** - special events you may roll for once you reach a town.

By default, your journey is **not timed** and there is **no extrinsic "reward"** for reaching the southern capital in the least days possible: whether you **rush through the steppes** or **hit every single town** in the region**, what matters is that you write it down** and **enjoy doing so**.

### *Gentlemen and ladies, welcome to Sulay.*
