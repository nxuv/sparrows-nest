### *The year is 2391*

Mankind has long expanded into the great starry void. War after war, its path across outer space was paved by the flesh and bone of the fallen, countless in number. Even now, at the dawn of newfound peace, the echoes of battles to come ring in the ears of the survivors, a grim reminder that all that lives is shackled to the unbreakable chains of history…

### *...but hey, at least we've got giant robot arenas now.*

Scattered across the Outer Colonies under the ownership of Galactica Sports Entertainment, "Fist World" combat circuits are a staple of recreational Battleframe combat, turning the worlds hosting them into bustling hubs of tourism, industry and under-the-counter gambling when the venue's rent-a-cops aren't looking.

### *So, all things considered, not a terrible deal.*

Especially for the populace of a remote planet that, after some two hundred years of isolation, resource scarcity and desperate struggle for survival, eventually saw its homeworld become the main theater of an interstellar conflict. After all, the cities are already in shambles and the planet's only moon has been sliced in two - letting some offworlders build a couple of stadiums could hardly make things any worse.

### *Welcome to Fist World Volga!*

Fist World Volga is a 1v1 "fighting board game", mixing the grid-based tactics of classic wargames like Battletech with the mechanical depth and unrelenting kineticism of arcade fighting games like Cyberbots: Full Metal Madness, Guilty Gear and...Zero Divide?

Step into the cockpit of the Divjak MKII Sporting Bioframe and duke it out in the squared circle as one of eight different Frame Configurations, each armed with a variety of dubiously accurate guns and flashy melee weapons - from plain old rocket-powered fists to giant gunblades!

Learn your frame's strengths and master its matchups: the general ruleset is fairly lightweight, so it all comes down to knowing your tools and denying the opponent the chance to use theirs.

That, or going full gorilla and hoping your next raw heavy is the right one.

### *After all, no play is a bad play if it worked.*
