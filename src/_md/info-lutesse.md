### *The year is 2405*

Almost twenty years after the brutal fall of the Avignon Empire, its once-shimmering capital city still stands as little more than a broken monument to fascist folly. The terror bombings may have stopped, and the foreign peacekeepers are mostly gone, but no  economic redevelopment program can make up for what was lost.

### *Siblings, cousins, parents - everyone lost someone back then.*

In the face of solitude and devastation, many of those who did banded together and escaped into the ruins - became misfits, or "Racailles". Back then, it was for survival: it was that, or waiting to get mulched by a rogue imperial mech plowing through your assigned refugee camp. Today, it's for belonging: to not die inside while making ends meet in a city that, by design, still feels like a prison to most.

### *A new and improved Nouvelle Lutesse - even newer, sleeker and more angular than ever before.*

Back then, those "Racailles" skated because it was fast, agile and took the edge off. It's not like you could just drive around what remained of the boulevards: first, because you never knew when a fight could break out between army remnants and peacekeepers; second, because you sure as hell didn't own an unexploded car. Twenty years later, they do because Alliance architects have unwittingly turned the city into a veritable skater paradise - and nowhere else is more true than in the West Side, home to most of the city's best skating spots.

### *You caught all that? Then tune in and turn up: it's Radio Free Lutesse.*
