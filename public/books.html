                    <h3><em>The year is 2000 A.D.</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        The world's foremost superpower, the Federation of
                        Pan-Europa, is heading into disarray.  As infrastructure
                        decays and violent militias carve up increasing swathes
                        of its territory,  the stability of its collective
                        unconscious also finds itself under siege from a whole
                        new kind of threat.
                    </p>
                    <h3><em>Psychohazards: viruses of the mind.</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Whether through purposeful misinformation or rumors
                        spiraling out of control, the threat posed by
                        psychohazards has led to the establishment of a new kind
                        of police unit: one meant to investigate and eradicate
                        them at the source - by any means necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h3><em>Enter the "Psycho Patrol".</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Founded by clamored criminologist Lorenzo Visconti as a
                        new kind of high-tech, anti-hitlerite force guided by
                        the principles of Wilhelm Reich, the European Federal
                        Police's new "Psycho Patrol" is a fledgling institution
                        unpopular among its peer organizations, but brimming
                        with potential. The perfect place for someone like you.
                    </p>
                    <h3><em>So misunderstood, so full of potential.</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        So go ahead, grab this zine and get acquainted:
                        featuring over 20 pages of useful tidbits, character
                        insights and mildly disconcerting fanart, ORIENTATION is
                        the perfect introduction to the peculiar world of PSYCHO
                        PATROL R, the latest in FPS/RPG europolice simulation by
                        CONSUMER SOFTPRODUCTS. This zine was composed with their
                        blessing and help, allowing us access to the game for
                        playtesting and design advisory purposes.

                        All in-game assets depicted, such as weapon models and
                        character portraits, were sourced from CONSUMER
                        SOFTPRODUCTS’ development archives, and all original
                        writing therein was carefully vetted before finalization
                        – to make sure each character’s individual neuroses are
                        rendered accurately and faithfully.

                    <p>
                        As the only human left on Twin Terra with an iron
                        backbone, a strong sense of justice and very few moral
                        boundaries, only you can pull the Pan-European
                        Federation back from the brink of disaster.
                    </p>
