                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>
                    Data Sparrow is a remotely-operated art collective active
                    since 2021, mostly operating in the fields of tabletop
                    gaming and music publishing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our main aesthetic touchstones include late 20th century
                    anime and videogames, but individual inspirations obviously
                    vary wildly from member to member - despite our shared
                    tendency to fall into mecha anime tangents whenever a
                    development session runs for long enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not a company, but we believe in a proper paper
                    trail. We are an art collective, but we're a friend group
                    before anything else. We believe that no idea is stupid
                    enough <em>not</em> to be put to paper, and we
                    <em>will</em> make games out of the least marketable
                    concepts we can think of just to see what happens - and
                    because, as it turns out, making art with your friends is
                    really fun. That and the fact that we're more or less all
                    fortunate enough to not have to treat this endeavor as our
                    dayjob, although the kickbacks do help.
                </p>
                <div style="padding: 0.7em;"></div>
                <h1>CORE TENETS</h1>
                <p>
                    Artistically speaking, Data Sparrow works are more or less
                    all built around three core tenets:
                    <strong>SIMPLICITY</strong>, <strong>SINCERITY</strong> and
                    <strong>STYLE</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>SIMPLICITY</strong> means making things that don't
                    take days of preparation to understand the rules for, or, if
                    we can optimize for it, set up. In the case of tabletop
                    games, that specifically means things you can buy, print and
                    play without excessive resource expenditure, with rules that
                    are simple to understand but kinetic enough in practice to
                    feel fresh and interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>SINCERITY</strong> means that, whatever the subject
                    of a particular work is, we do our best to treat it with
                    respect and conduct appropriate research. We don't make
                    things about topics we don't personally enjoy or find
                    interesting - and we hope that, through play, you may get
                    interested too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>STYLE</strong> means a marriage of beauty and
                    practicality: a meeting between minimalist layout designed
                    for ease of printing, paired with lavish key art in a
                    variety of visual styles, using a variety of composition
                    techniques - from 2D art to 3D renders to photo-compositing,
                    the only limit is our own capabilities.
                </p>
                <div style="padding: 0.7em;"></div>
                <h1>UNIFIED SETTING</h1>
                <p>
                    Most Data Sparrow games take place in a unified science
                    fiction setting designed from the ground up as a creative
                    playground in which to explore a variety of aesthetics,
                    themes and game genres. That, and because developing a
                    single setting over multiple projects helps you build a very
                    useful backlog of visual assets you can recycle and
                    historical events you can use to greatly expedite
                    worldbuilding. Work smarter, not harder.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That said, we're not on some narrative
                    <abbr title="Fear Of Missing Out"><span>FOMO</span></abbr
                    >, "cinematic universe" nonsense. The intricacies of 24th
                    century powerboat racing are not necessary to understand why
                    the capital city of a dead empire is now a very pretty
                    open-air prison. Every Data Sparrow work is, ultimately, a
                    standalone affair, from which you may extrapolate a few,
                    entirely optional, background "narrative arcs" by following
                    the path of recurring players - like certain corporations or
                    non-state actors.
                </p>
                <p>But you can also not do that, and that's entirely ok.</p>
                <div style="padding: 0.7em;"></div>
                <h1>...WHY'D YOU REWRITE THIS PAGE?</h1>
                <p>
                    If you're a returning visitor, you may notice this page used
                    to read a lot differently - and, in some aspects, a lot
                    worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's because, at the time of writing, the writer (who is
                    also writing this new page. Hi!) didn't think highly enough
                    of their work to present it in an objective light. All that
                    talk about being "all-too-eager hobbyists" was preemptive
                    deflection of negative criticism born from insecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in 2025, we released four games and a very important
                    promotional zine, alongside a slew of complementary material
                    for all the above. Aside from working him to near burnout,
                    this escalation in capabilities and output finally made him
                    realize that Data Sparrow is an outfit worthy of respect if
                    not, according to some of our peers, a "class act". This
                    rewrite is an effort in finally acting like it.
                </p>
