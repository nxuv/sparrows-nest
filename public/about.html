                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>
                    We could open this section with a statement about the
                    meaning of our name: about how the fleeting, virtual essence
                    of the “Data Sparrow” is an allegory for a collective with
                    no physical headquarters, no “roots” but rather “wings”,
                    spanning across this strange world in the form of our
                    members – as it’s only thanks them that the Sparrow can take
                    flight and reach new heights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that’d be one flight of fancy too many for what amounts
                    to a group of all-too-eager hobbyists, so let’s keep our
                    feet on the ground for now.
                </p>
                <div style="padding: 0.2em;"></div>
                <h1>SO, WHAT IS DATA SPARROW?</h1>
                <p>
                    Basically, Data Sparrow is an art collective. For what kind
                    of art? Whichever we have the facilities and ideas to
                    pursue, mostly. Currently, we’re focusing on tabletop games
                    and printed media. In the future? Who knows! Nothing is off
                    the table aside from a few, obviously unethical endeavors
                    that have been catching on these past couple of years, so if
                    we ever have the means to actually put out a videogame or
                    two, we’ll most certainly try.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our aesthetic preferences and areas of expertise are as many
                    as our members, but our founding value is the point around
                    which it all pivots: branch out whenever you can, don’t let
                    ideas overstay their welcome, keep it varied and fun.
                </p>
                <div style="padding: 0.2em;"></div>
                <h1>ONE UNIVERSE…</h1>
                <p>
                    To this end, our projects currently take place in a single,
                    expansive universe designed from the ground up as a creative
                    playground with minimal guidelines. This streamlines
                    setting-level writing immensely, as all projects get to be
                    on the same historical timeline and all that’s needed is
                    defining the details of the particular locations in which
                    each project takes place.
                </p>
                <div style="padding: 0.2em;"></div>
                <h1>…MANY STORIES</h1>
                <p>
                    This, however, doesn’t mean there’s some sort of grand
                    converging narrative going on: every Data Sparrow endeavor
                    is a standalone work, whose only references to other works
                    amount to the natural amounts of cross-pollination resulting
                    from two planets being neighbors, or two sports occupying
                    the same niche. You can come in wherever, you can come out
                    wherever.
                </p>

                    If any of this stuff sounds up your alley, you’re welcome to
                    take a look at our projects and
                    <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you want to know more
                    about anything we’re currently working on! We don’t like to
                    show things publicly unless we know they fundamentally work
                    and are 100% going to be released, but a question or two
                    never hurt anyone.
