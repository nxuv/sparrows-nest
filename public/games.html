                        Mankind has long expanded into the great starry void.
                        War after war, its path across outer space was paved by
                        the flesh and bone of the fallen, countless in number.
                        Even now, at the dawn of newfound peace, the echoes of
                        battles to come ring in the ears of the survivors, a
                        grim reminder that all that lives is shackled to the
                        unbreakable chains of history…

                        hubs of tourism, industry and under-the-counter gambling
                        when the venue's rent-a-cops aren't looking.

                        Especially for the populace of a remote planet that,
                        after some two hundred years of isolation, resource
                        scarcity and desperate struggle for survival, eventually
                        saw its homeworld become the main theater of an
                        interstellar conflict. After all, the cities are already
                        in shambles and the planet's only moon has been sliced

                        Battletech with the mechanical depth and unrelenting

                    <p>
                        Seven years after the tide of violence wrought by the
                        Great Colonial War upset a century-old balance of power,
                        humanity is once again entering an era of fragile peace.
                        From the ashes of the old Avignon Empire, firestarter of
                        the conflict, a federation of former vassal worlds has
                        risen - denying the tantalizing offer of growth and
                        prosperity under the ever-increasing reach of the United
                        Systems Alliance in favor of long-awaited independence.
                    </p>
                    <h3><em>Welcome to the Tremerine Union.</em></h3>
                    <p>
                        Built on the principles of "Safety, Equality and
                        Dignity" and spanning nine worlds over four star
                        systems, the Tremerine Union has since established
                        itself as a respectably powerful player on the galactic
                        chessboard - something of a middle ground between the
                        Alliance's gossamer state and the Terran Protectorate's
                        more authoritarian rulings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Focused on building over the decadence and devastation
                        left in the wake of Avignon's fall, the Union has been
                        working tirelessly to secure the great spaceways and the
                        latest colonies discovered by the empire's Expanse
                        Initiative, which in the meantime had become safe havens
                        for surviving imperial remnants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This effort would soon lead to the establishment of a
                        national self-defense fleet, doing away with the
                        "opportunity-based" mercenary army model taken from the
                        Alliance in the early, turbulent years of reunification.
                        This fleet now patrols the sea of stars, on the lookout
                        for anyone daring enough to challenge this new peace.

                        search of profits, or simply looking for a good time.
                        Each of you may come from a different background or work
                        a different profession, but you will need to cooperate

                        A decade after the war that shook the Outer Colonies and
                        brought the Avignon Empire to its knees, the
                        Confederation of Shardana, an idyllic ocean world in the
                        Aurelia System, has finally returned to relative
                        normalcy. As the hulks of orbital warships float along

                        has come to pass - and now, the only way to go is

                        for whole new ones. And so, as the lights go green and

                        themselves in tune - a single sentence flashing forth in

                        armed with a unique Equipment Piece to turn the odds in
                        its favor - whether it's simple Naval Airbrakes or
                        Self-Repair Nanites.

                        By default, the game also comes with six courses through
                        which said chasses can be raced, all of which are easily
                        set up thanks to a modular "Marker Buoy" system -
                        mirroring the way real powerboat competitions set up
                        their courses. Thanks to this same modularity however,
                        players can just as easily build their own tracks - a
                        process facilitated by the Custom Venue Profiles
                        available in the game's free Companion Booklet.

                        Lightyears away from the blossoming Cosmic East, the sea
                        of stars has become a battlefield to a silent civil war,
                        seeded and spurred on by galactic superpowers. The
                        prize? The allegiance of the Sovereignty of Sirius, the
                        richest among the Inner Colonies.

                    <p>
                        Ruled by a theocratic order of ancient design, the
                        Sovereignty of Sirius stands at an impass, the divide
                        between its ruling caste and worker caste reaching its
                        widest point in centuries. A specter of dissent creeps
                        among the populace, and it bears the flag of the
                        "Naxalites" - a collectivist movement aligned with the
                        Sovereignty's lifelong enemies: the increasingly
                        influential Terran Protectorate.

                        Weaponizing the mounting dissatisfaction of rebellious
                        elements across all castes, a concerted effort to supply
                        and direct them has manifested itself into increasingly
                        frequent voidborne terror attacks. Attacks in which the

                        of EM pulses, and in which desperate pleas, panicked

                        pacts, treaties and conventions. The age of the sword,
                        of the fleur du lys and military nobility is over.

                        been reshaped by the invisible hand of capital. The Most

                        Triunfo Solidarity Republic.

                        warfare card game inspired by Machi Koro, Monopoly and
                        the 1979 Dune board game, in which you and three
                        soon-to-be-enemies take the role of Coordinators:
                        shadowy corporate figures doubling as both executives
                        and military strategists, trying to carve out as big as
                        slice of Triunfo's economy as you can in a
                        no-cards-barred contest of risky acquisitions, frequent
                        betrayal and bluff-based card combat. Win by sheer
                        market share, military power or by wooing the Republic's
                        government with an Artificial Wonder. And remember:
                        destruction is not "mutually assured" if you own all the

                    <p>
                        After a century of intermittent conflict, peace seems
                        within reach on the Inner Colonial world of Tau Ceti II.
                        The Greater Sulay Peninsula, mainly known across the
                        galaxy as the backdrop to sun-bleached combat footage
                        and exploitative action films, might have finally
                        reached a critical turning point.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        <em>A tired peace, born from regret and exhaustion.</em>

                    <p>
                        Despite significant ideological and cultural divides,
                        the reality of a frozen frontline, dwindling foreign
                        support and the progressively unjustifiable cost of war
                        have pushed the parties involved to finally,
                        begrudgingly sit at the same table. Representing the
                        north, the Sulay Socialist Assembly: a socialist
                        republic backed by the Terran Protectorate; representing
                        the south, the Southern Sulay Emirates: a league of
                        Sunni citystates backed by the United Systems Alliance.

                    <p>
                        From either sides of the Baghlani-Kanzeb Line, a
                        tentative sigh of collective relief ushers the dawn of
                        (hopefully) better days. Once inconceivable shows of
                        cooperation between the two polities begin making the
                        rounds across the galactic infonet - to include a
                        particular racing event, a cross-country charity drive
                        bridging the gap between philantrophy, cultural
                        preservation and offroading thrills.

                        Almost twenty years after the brutal fall of the Avignon
                        Empire, its once-shimmering capital city still stands as
                        little more than a broken monument to fascist folly. The
                        terror bombings may have stopped, and the foreign
                        peacekeepers are mostly gone, but no economic
                        redevelopment program can make up for what was lost.

                        In the face of solitude and devastation, many of those
                        who did banded together and escaped into the ruins -
                        became misfits, or "Racailles". Back then, it was for
                        survival: it was that, or waiting to get mulched by a
                        rogue imperial mech plowing through your assigned
                        refugee camp. Today, it's for belonging: to not die
                        inside while making ends meet in a city that, by design,
                        still feels like a prison to most.

                        Back then, those "Racailles" skated because it was fast,
                        agile and took the edge off. It's not like you could
                        just drive around what remained of the boulevards:
                        first, because you never knew when a fight could break
                        out between army remnants and peacekeepers; second,
                        because you sure as hell didn't own an unexploded car.
                        Twenty years later, they do because Alliance architects
                        have unwittingly turned the city into a veritable skater
                        paradise - and nowhere else is more true than in the
                        West Side, home to most of the city's best skating
                        spots.
